Currently it supports 6 different checks:

2 - Hibernation state 
3 - Current bandwidth 
4 - OR port reachability 
5 - DIR port reachability 
6 - Bytes remaining until hibernation

Suggestions? Bug fixes? You should know that I much prefer SVN to Git, so this is just a public hosting spot. If you want to submit a bug fix or something, you'd be much better served by emailing me a patch diff. Additionally, as a consequence, the code here might be out of date.
